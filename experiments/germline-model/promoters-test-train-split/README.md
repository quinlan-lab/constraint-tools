## Steps to complete this experiment 

- [x] Run `experiments/germline-model/promoters-test-train-split/train_test_split.ipynb` to split promoters into train and test subsets
- [ ] :thumbsup: Run `download-process-data/compute-neutral-regions.sh` to exclude test promoters from set of neutral regions on which substitution probabilities, etc, are estimated
